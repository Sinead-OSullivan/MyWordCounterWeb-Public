Many children in Ireland and around the world suffer from Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), which is associated with poor literacy skills in later life, limited employment opportunities, and mental health problems. Speech therapists have developed effective treatment programmes for DLD, but accurately assessing individual needs presents problems. The current standard test involves counting the number of words a child learns over a given period of therapy. However, research suggests that other variables should be taken into account, e.g., how many times a child was exposed to a particular word before learning its meaning, whether the word was read or heard, etc.

The proposed solution is an android app that will record a child speaking target words in various ways (in isolation, in short phrases, and in sentences), and then recognise those words when they are spoken during therapeutic activities and count the number of times each is used. The system is able either to count the total number of utterances of the target words over a period of time, or alert the users when a predefined total or time limit has been reached. Data gathered by the app is stored in a database, with provision for therapists to search and view the results.

This project is being conducted in collaboration with staff from the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences at UCC.

This repository stores the website application for the project, which was previously hosted at [My Word Counter](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~sos17/MyWordCounterWeb/).
